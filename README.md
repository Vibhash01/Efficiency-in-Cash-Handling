Cash Handling Efficiency (using Greedy Algorithm)

The is a simple program written in c++ language,
it calculates the optimal change to be returned to a customer based on the amount to be paid and the amount paid by the customer. 
It then displays the change in the best denominations available.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Features:

Support for Indian currency denominations.
Displays the total change amount along with the denominations.

Further scope and enhancements:
Support for multiple currencies.
Integration with Payment Systems.
